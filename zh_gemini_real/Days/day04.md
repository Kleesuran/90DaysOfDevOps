## DevOps & Agile

Do you know the difference between DevOps and Agile? They were formed as standalone concepts. But now the two terms are getting fused.
你知道DevOps和敏捷（Agile）之间的区别吗？它们最初是作为独立的概念形成的。但现在这两个术语正逐渐融合。

In this post, we will examine the crucial differences between Agile and DevOps and find out why the two are connected so tightly.
在这篇文章中，我们将探讨敏捷和DevOps之间的关键差异，并找出为什么两者联系得如此紧密。

I think a good place to start is understanding a little more about a common angle I have seen in learning this area and that is DevOps vs Agile, even though they have similar goals and processes. In this section, I am going to summarise this hopefully.
我认为一个好的起点是更多地了解我在学习这个领域时常见的一个角度，即DevOps与敏捷的对比，尽管它们有着相似的目标和流程。在本节中，我希望能对此进行总结。

Let's start with definitions.
让我们从定义开始。

### Agile Development

Agile is an approach that focuses on delivering small results faster rather than releasing one big interaction of the product; software is developed in iterations. The team releases a new version every week or month with incremental updates. The final goal of Agile is to deliver an optimal experience to the end-users.
敏捷是一种侧重于更快地交付小成果，而不是发布产品的一次大型交互的方法；软件是迭代开发的。团队每周或每月发布一个带有增量更新的新版本。敏捷的最终目标是为最终用户提供最佳体验。

### DevOps

We have been covering this for the past few days with a few different ways of describing the end goals of DevOps. DevOps usually describes software development
过去几天我们已经以几种不同的方式来描述DevOps的最终目标。DevOps通常描述的是基于软件开发人员和运维专家之间协作的软件开发和交付实践。
and delivery practices based on cooperation between software developers and operations specialists. The main DevOps benefits are delivering a simplified development process and minimising miscommunication.
DevOps的主要优势是提供简化的开发流程并最大限度地减少错误沟通。

## What is the difference between Agile and DevOps

The difference is mainly the preoccupations. Agile and DevOps have different preoccupations but they are helping each other. Agile wants short iteration, which is only possible with the automation that DevOps brings. Agile wants the customer to try a specific version and quickly give feedback which is only possible if DevOps make the creation of a new environment easily.
区别主要在于关注点。敏捷和DevOps有着不同的关注点，但它们相互帮助。敏捷需要短迭代周期，这只有通过DevOps带来的自动化才有可能实现。敏捷希望客户能够尝试特定的版本并迅速提供反馈，这只有在DevOps能够轻松创建新环境时才有可能实现。

### Different participants

Agile focuses on optimising communication between end-users and developers while DevOps targets developers and operation, team members. We could say that agile is outward-oriented toward customers whereas DevOps is a set of internal practices.
敏捷侧重于优化最终用户和开发人员之间的沟通，而DevOps则针对开发人员和运维团队成员。我们可以说敏捷是面向客户的外向型实践，而DevOps是一套内部实践。

### Team

Agile usually applies to software developers and project managers. The competencies of DevOps engineers lie in the intersection of development, QA (quality assurance) and operations as they are involved in all stages of the product cycle and are part of the Agile team.
敏捷通常适用于软件开发人员和项目经理。DevOps工程师的能力在于开发、质量保证（QA）和运维的交叉领域，因为他们参与了产品周期的所有阶段，并且是敏捷团队的一部分。

### Applied Frameworks

Agile has a lot of management frameworks to achieve flexibility and transparency: Scrum > Kanban > Lean > Extreme > Crystal > Dynamic > Feature-Driven. DevOps focuses on the development approach in collaboration but doesn't offer specific methodologies. However, DevOps promote practices like Infrastructure as Code, Architecture as Code, Monitoring, Self Healing, end to end test automation ... But per se this is not a framework, but rather practice.
敏捷有许多管理框架来实现灵活性和透明度：Scrum > Kanban > Lean > Extreme > Crystal > Dynamic > Feature-Driven。DevOps专注于协作的开发方法，但不提供具体的 методологии（方法论）。然而，DevOps推广诸如基础设施即代码、架构即代码、监控、自愈、端到端测试自动化等实践... 但就其本身而言，这不是一个框架，而是一种实践。

### Feedback

In Agile the main source of feedback is the end-user while in DevOps the feedback from stakeholders and the team itself has a higher priority.
在敏捷中，反馈的主要来源是最终用户，而在DevOps中，来自利益相关者和团队本身的反馈具有更高的优先级。

### Target areas

Agile focuses more on software development than deployment and maintenance. DevOps focuses on software development as well but its values and tools also cover deployment and post-release stages like monitoring, high availability, security and data protection.
敏捷侧重于软件开发多于部署和维护。DevOps也侧重于软件开发，但其价值和工具也涵盖部署和发布后阶段，如监控、高可用性、安全和数据保护。

### Documentation

Agile prioritises flexibility and tasks at hand over documentation and monitoring. DevOps on the other hand regards project documentation as one of the essential project components.
敏捷优先考虑灵活性和手头任务，而不是文档和监控。另一方面，DevOps将项目文档视为基本项目组成部分之一。

### Risks

Agile risks derive from the flexibility of the methodology. Agile projects are difficult to predict or evaluate as priorities and requirements are continually changing.
敏捷的风险来源于该方法的灵活性。敏捷项目难以预测或评估，因为优先级和需求不断变化。

DevOps risks derive from a misunderstanding of the term and the lack of suitable tools. Some people see DevOps as a collection of software for the deployment and continuous integration failing to change the underlying structure of the development process.
DevOps的风险源于对该术语的误解以及缺乏合适的工具。一些人将DevOps视为用于部署和持续集成的一系列软件集合，而未能改变开发过程的底层结构。

### The Tools Used

Agile tools are focused on management communication collaboration, metrics and feedback processing. The most popular agile tools include JIRA, Trello, Slack, Zoom, SurveyMonkey and others.
敏捷工具侧重于管理沟通协作、指标和反馈处理。最流行的敏捷工具包括 JIRA, Trello, Slack, Zoom, SurveyMonkey 和其他。

DevOps uses tools for team communication, software development, deployment and integration like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, BitBucket, etc. Even though agile and DevOps have slightly different focuses and scopes the key values are almost identical, therefore you can combine the two.
DevOps 使用用于团队沟通、软件开发、部署和集成的工具，例如 Jenkins, GitHub Actions, BitBucket 等。尽管敏捷和DevOps的侧重点和范围略有不同，但关键价值几乎相同，因此您可以将两者结合起来。

## Bring it all together… good idea or not? Discuss?

The combination of Agile and DevOps brings the following benefits you will get:
敏捷和DevOps的结合将带来以下好处：

- Flexible management and powerful technology.
- 灵活的管理和强大的技术。
- Agile practices help DevOps teams to communicate their priorities more efficiently.
- 敏捷实践有助于DevOps团队更有效地传达其优先级。
- The automation cost that you have to pay for your DevOps practices is justified by your agile requirement of deploying quickly and frequently.
- 你的DevOps实践所必须支付的自动化成本，可通过敏捷要求快速频繁部署来证明其合理性。
- It leads to strengthening: the team adopting agile practices will improve collaboration, increase the team's motivation and decrease employee turnover rates.
- 它带来了强化：采用敏捷实践的团队将改善协作、提高团队积极性并降低员工流失率。
- As a result, you get better product quality.
- 结果是，您将获得更好的产品质量。

Agile allows coming back to previous product development stages to fix errors and prevent the accumulation of technical debt. To adopt agile and DevOps
敏捷允许返回到之前的产品开发阶段来修复错误并防止技术债的积累。要同时采用敏捷和DevOps，只需遵循以下7个步骤：
simultaneously just follow 7 steps:

1. Unite the development and operation teams.
1. 团结开发和运维团队。
2. Create build and run teams, all development and operational concerns are discussed by the entire DevOps team.
2. 创建构建和运行团队，所有开发和运维方面的顾虑都由整个DevOps团队讨论。
3. Change your approach to sprints, and assign priority ratings to offer DevOps tasks that have the same value as development tasks. Encourage development and operations teams to exchange their opinion on other teams' workflow and possible issues.
3. 改变你对冲刺（sprints）的处理方法，并分配优先级等级，以提供与开发任务具有相同价值的DevOps任务。鼓励开发和运维团队就其他团队的工作流程和可能的问题交换意见。
4. Include QA in all development stages.
4. 在所有开发阶段都纳入质量保证（QA）。
5. Choose the right tools.
5. 选择合适的工具。
6. Automate everything you can.
6. 自动化所有可以自动化的事物。
7. Measure and control by using tangible numeric deliverables.
7. 使用切实的数字可交付成果进行衡量和控制。

What do you think? Do you have different views? I want to hear from Developers, Operations, QA or anyone that has a better understanding of Agile and DevOps that can pass comments and feedback on this?
你怎么看？你是否有不同的观点？我希望听到开发人员、运维人员、质量保证人员（QA）或任何对敏捷和DevOps有更好理解的人提出评论和反馈？
