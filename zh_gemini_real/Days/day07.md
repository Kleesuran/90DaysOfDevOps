## The Big Picture: DevOps & Learning a Programming Language

I think it is fair to say to be successful in the long term as a DevOps engineer you've got to know at least one programming language at a foundational level.
我认为可以公平地说，要想作为一名 DevOps 工程师取得长期的成功，你至少需要掌握一门编程语言的基础知识。
I want to take this first session of this section to explore why this is such a critical skill to have, and hopefully, by the end of this week or section, you are going to have a better understanding of the why, how and what to do to progress with your learning journey.
我想利用本节的第一次会议来探讨为什么这是一项至关重要的技能，并希望在本周或本节结束时，您能更好地理解“为什么”、“如何”以及“做什么”来推进您的学习旅程。

I think if I was to ask out on social do you need to have programming skills for DevOps related roles, the answer will be most likely a hard yes?
我想，如果我在社交媒体上提问，从事 DevOps 相关角色是否需要编程技能，答案很可能是一个坚定的“是”？
Let me know if you think otherwise?
如果您有不同的看法，请告诉我。
Ok but then a bigger question and this is where you won't get such a clear answer which programming language?
好的，但接下来的一个更大的问题是，你不会得到一个如此明确的答案：究竟是哪种编程语言？
The most common answer I have seen here has been Python or increasingly more often, we're seeing Golang or Go should be the language that you learn.
我在这里看到的最常见答案是 Python，或者越来越多地，我们看到 Golang 或 Go 应该是你应该学习的语言。

To be successful in DevOps you have to have a good knowledge of programming skills is my takeaway from that at least.
至少我的理解是，要在 DevOps 领域取得成功，你必须对编程技能有很好的了解。
But we have to understand why we need it to choose the right path.
但我们必须理解为什么需要它，才能选择正确的道路。

## Understand why you need to learn a programming language.

The reason that Python and Go are recommended so often for DevOps engineers is that a lot of the DevOps tooling is written in either Python or Go, which makes sense if you are going to be building DevOps tools.
Python 和 Go 之所以经常被推荐给 DevOps 工程师，是因为许多 DevOps 工具都是用 Python 或 Go 编写的，这在你打算构建 DevOps 工具时是很合理的。
Now this is important as this will determine really what you should learn and that would likely be the most beneficial.
这一点很重要，因为它将真正决定你应该学习什么，以及什么可能最有利。
If you are going to be building DevOps tools or you are joining a team that does then it would make sense to learn that same language, if you are going to be heavily involved in Kubernetes or Containers then it's more than likely that you would want to choose Go as your programming language.
如果你打算构建 DevOps 工具，或者你正在加入一个做这项工作的团队，那么学习相同的语言是有意义的；如果你将大量参与 Kubernetes 或容器相关工作，那么你很可能希望选择 Go 作为你的编程语言。
For me, the company I work for (Kasten by Veeam) is in the Cloud-Native ecosystem focused on data management for Kubernetes and everything is written in Go.
对我来说，我所工作的公司 (Kasten by Veeam) 专注于 Kubernetes 的数据管理，属于云原生生态系统，并且所有东西都是用 Go 编写的。

But then you might not have clear cut reasoning like that to choose you might be a student or transitioning careers with no real decision made for you.
但是，你可能没有这样明确的理由来做选择，你可能是一名学生，或者正在进行职业转型，还没有为你做出真正的决定。
I think in this situation then you should choose the one that seems to resonate and fit with the applications you are looking to work with.
我认为在这种情况下，你应该选择一个似乎能引起共鸣并适合你想要使用的应用程序的语言。

Remember I am not looking to become a software developer here I just want to understand a little more about the programming language so that I can read and understand what those tools are doing and then that leads to possibly how we can help improve things.
请记住，我在这里不是想成为一名软件开发人员，我只是想更多地了解这门编程语言，以便我能够阅读和理解这些工具正在做什么，然后这可能会引导我们如何帮助改进事物。

It is also important to know how you interact with those DevOps tools which could be Kasten K10 or it could be Terraform and HCL.
了解你如何与这些 DevOps 工具交互也很重要，这些工具可能是 Kasten K10，也可能是 Terraform 和 HCL。
These are what we will call config files and this is how you interact with those DevOps tools to make things happen, commonly these are going to be YAML.
我们将这些称为配置文件，这是你与那些 DevOps 工具交互以实现功能的方式，通常它们会是 YAML 文件。
(We may use the last day of this section to dive a little into YAML)
（我们可能会利用本节的最后一天稍微深入研究一下 YAML）

## Did I just talk myself out of learning a programming language?

Most of the time or depending on the role, you will be helping engineering teams implement DevOps into their workflow, a lot of testing around the application and making sure that the workflow that is built aligns to those DevOps principles we mentioned over the first few days.
大多数情况下，或根据角色的不同，你将协助工程团队在其工作流程中实施 DevOps，围绕应用程序进行大量的测试，并确保所构建的工作流程符合我们在前几天提到的 DevOps 原则。
But in reality, this is going to be a lot of the time troubleshooting an application performance issue or something along those lines.
但在现实中，这在很多时候将是排查应用程序性能问题或类似的事情。
This comes back to my original point and reasoning, the programming language I need to know is the one that the code is written in?
这又回到了我最初的观点和推理：我需要知道的编程语言应该是编写代码的那种语言，对吗？
If their application is written in NodeJS it won’t help much if you have a Go or Python badge.
如果他们的应用程序是用 NodeJS 编写的，那么如果你只有 Go 或 Python 的经验，帮助不会太大。

## Why Go

Why Golang is the next programming language for DevOps, Go has become a very popular programming language in recent years.
为什么 Golang 是 DevOps 的下一个编程语言？Go 在最近几年已经成为一种非常流行的编程语言。
According to the StackOverflow Survey for 2021 Go came in fourth for the most wanted Programming, scripting and markup languages with Python being top but hear me out.
根据 2021 年的 StackOverflow 调查，Go 在最受欢迎的编程、脚本和标记语言中排名第四，Python 位居榜首，但请听我解释。

[StackOverflow 2021 年开发者调查——最受欢迎链接](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)

As I have also mentioned some of the most known DevOps tools and platforms are written in Go such as Kubernetes, Docker, Grafana and Prometheus.
正如我也提到过的，一些最著名的 DevOps 工具和平台是用 Go 编写的，例如 Kubernetes、Docker、Grafana 和 Prometheus。

What are some of the characteristics of Go that make it great for DevOps?
Go 有哪些特性使其非常适合 DevOps？

## Build and Deployment of Go Programs

An advantage of using a language like Python that is interpreted in a DevOps role is that you don’t need to compile a python program before running it.
在 DevOps 角色中，使用像 Python 这样的解释型语言的优势在于，你不需要在运行它之前编译 Python 程序。
Especially for smaller automation tasks, you don’t want to be slowed down by a build process that requires compilation even though, Go is a compiled programming language, **Go compiles directly into machine code**.
特别是对于较小的自动化任务，你不希望被需要编译的构建过程拖慢速度，尽管 Go 是一种编译型编程语言，但 **Go 直接编译成机器码**。
Go is known also for fast compilation times.
Go 也以快速的编译时间而闻名。

## Go vs Python for DevOps

Go Programs are statically linked, this means that when you compile a go program everything is included in a single binary executable, and no external dependencies will be required that would need to be installed on the remote machine, this makes the deployment of go programs easy, compared to python program that uses external libraries you have to make sure that all those libraries are installed on the remote machine that you wish to run on.
Go 程序是静态链接的，这意味着当你编译一个 Go 程序时，所有内容都包含在一个单独的二进制可执行文件中，并且不需要安装在远程机器上的外部依赖项，这使得 Go 程序的部署变得容易。相比之下，使用外部库的 Python 程序，你必须确保所有这些库都安装在你希望运行它的远程机器上。

Go is a platform-independent language, which means you can produce binary executables for \*all the operating systems, Linux, Windows, macOS etc and very easy to do so.
Go 是一种平台无关的语言，这意味着你可以为*所有*操作系统（Linux、Windows、macOS 等）生成二进制可执行文件，并且这样做非常容易。
With Python, it is not as easy to create these binary executables for particular operating systems.
对于 Python 来说，为特定的操作系统创建这些二进制可执行文件并不那么容易。

Go is a very performant language, it has fast compilation and fast run time with lower resource usage like CPU and memory especially compared to python, numerous optimisations have been implemented in the Go language that makes it so performant. (Resources below)
Go 是一种性能非常高的语言，它具有快速的编译和运行时间，资源使用率较低，尤其是与 Python 相比（如 CPU 和内存），Go 语言中实施了许多优化措施使其具有如此高的性能。（资源见下文）

Unlike Python which often requires the use of third party libraries to implement a particular python program, go includes a standard library that has the majority of functionality that you would need for DevOps built directly into it.
与 Python 不同（Python 通常需要使用第三方库来实现特定的 Python 程序），Go 包含一个标准库，其中内置了 DevOps 所需的大多数功能。
This includes functionality file processing, HTTP web services, JSON processing, native support for concurrency and parallelism as well as built-in testing.
这包括文件处理、HTTP Web 服务、JSON 处理、对并发和并行化的原生支持以及内置测试功能。

This is by no way throwing Python under the bus I am just giving my reasons for choosing Go but they are not the above Go vs Python it's generally because it makes sense as the company I work for develops software in Go so that is why.
这绝不是贬低 Python，我只是给出我选择 Go 的原因，但我的原因并不是上面列出的 Go 与 Python 的对比，通常是因为我工作的公司是用 Go 开发软件的，所以选择 Go 对我来说是有意义的。

I will say that once you have or at least I am told as I am not many pages into this chapter right now, is that once you learn your first programming language it becomes easier to take on other languages.
我想说的是，一旦你掌握了第一门编程语言（或者至少我是听说的，因为我现在对这章还没学多少），学习其他语言就会变得更容易。
You're probably never going to have a single job in any company anywhere where you don't have to deal with managing, architect, orchestrating, debug JavaScript and Node JS applications.
无论你在任何公司的任何地方工作，你可能永远不会遇到一份不需要处理管理、架构、编排、调试 JavaScript 和 Node JS 应用程序的工作。
