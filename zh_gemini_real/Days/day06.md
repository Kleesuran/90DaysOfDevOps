## DevOps - The real stories

DevOps to begin with was seen to be out of reach for a lot of us as we didn't have companies like Netflix or a fortune 500 company practising it but I think that now it's beginning to sway into the normal as businesses start adopting a DevOps practice.
DevOps 最初被认为对我们很多人来说遥不可及，因为我们身边没有像 Netflix 或财富 500 强公司那样实践它的企业，但我认为现在随着企业开始采用 DevOps 实践，它正逐渐变得普及。

You will see from the below references that there are a lot of different industries and verticals using DevOps and hence having a huge positive effect on their business objectives.
您将从下面的参考资料中看到，有许多不同的行业和垂直领域正在使用 DevOps，从而对其业务目标产生了巨大的积极影响。

The overarching benefit here is that DevOps if done correctly should help improve your business's speed and quality of software development.
这里的首要好处是，如果正确实施，DevOps 应该有助于提高企业的软件开发速度和质量。

I wanted to take this day to look at successful companies that have adopted a DevOps practice and share some resources around this. This will be a great oppurtunity for the community to dive in and help here. Have you adopted a DevOps culture in your business? Has it been successful?
我想利用今天的时间来研究那些成功采用了 DevOps 实践的公司，并分享一些相关的资源。这将是社区深入研究和提供帮助的绝佳机会。您的企业是否采用了 DevOps 文化？它成功了吗？

I mentioned Netflix above and will touch on them again as it is a very good model and quite advanced compared to what we generally see today but I'll also mention some other big brands that are succeeding at this.
我上面提到了 Netflix，并将再次讨论它们，因为这是一个非常好的模式，而且与我们今天普遍看到的相比相当先进，但我也将提及其他一些在这方面取得成功的知名品牌。

## Amazon

In 2010 Amazon moved their physical server footprint to the AWS(Amazon Web Services) cloud. This allowed them to save resources by scaling capacity up and down in very small increments. We also know that AWS went on to generate high revenue itself whilst running Amazon's retail branch.
2010 年，亚马逊将其物理服务器足迹迁移到了 AWS（Amazon Web Services）云。这使他们能够通过以非常小的增量扩展容量来实现资源的节约。我们也知道，AWS 在运营亚马逊零售业务的同时，自身也产生了高额收入。

Amazon adopted in 2011 (according to the link below) a continued deployment process where their developers could deploy code whenever they wanted and to whichever servers they needed to. This enabled Amazon to achieve deploying new software to production servers at an average of 11.6 seconds!
亚马逊在 2011 年（根据下面的链接）采用了持续部署流程，开发人员可以随时将代码部署到他们需要的任何服务器上。这使得亚马逊能够实现平均 11.6 秒就将新软件部署到生产服务器上的壮举！

## Netflix

Who doesn't use Netflix? It's a high quality streaming service and personally speaking, has a great user experience.
谁不用 Netflix 呢？它是一种高质量的流媒体服务，就个人而言，它拥有出色的用户体验。

Why is that user experience so great? Well, the ability to deliver a service with no personal recollection of glitches requires speed, flexibility, and attention to quality.
为什么用户体验如此出色？嗯，提供服务的过程中没有用户感知到的故障，这需要速度、灵活性和对质量的关注。

Netflix developers can automatically build pieces of code into deployable web images without relying on IT operations. As the images are updated, they are integrated into Netflix’s infrastructure using a custom-built, web-based platform.
Netflix 开发人员无需依赖 IT 运营，即可自动将代码片段构建成可部署的 Web 镜像。随着镜像的更新，它们会使用定制的、基于 Web 的平台集成到 Netflix 的基础设施中。

Continuous Monitoring is in place so that if the deployment of the images fails, the new images are rolled back and traffic is rerouted back to the previous version.
持续监控已部署到位，因此如果镜像部署失败，新的镜像将被回滚，流量将被重新路由回先前的版本。

There is a great talk listed below that goes into more about the DOs and DONTs that Netflix lives and dies by within their teams.
下面列出了一个精彩的演讲，其中更深入地介绍了 Netflix 团队中奉行和避免的行为规范（DOs and DONTs）。

## Etsy

As with many of us and with many companies, there was a real struggle around slow and painful deployments. In the same vein, we might have also experienced working in companies that have lots of silos and teams that are not working well together.
与我们中的许多人以及许多公司一样，围绕着缓慢而痛苦的部署，曾存在着真正的挣扎。同样，我们也可能经历过在筒仓众多、团队协作不佳的公司中工作。

From what I can make out by reading about Amazon and Netflix is that Etsy might have adopted letting developers deploy their code around the end of 2009 which might have been even before the other two. (Interesting!)
通过阅读有关亚马逊和 Netflix 的资料，我可以推断出，Etsy 可能早在 2009 年底左右就采用了允许开发人员部署代码的做法，这甚至可能比其他两家公司更早。（有趣！）

An interesting takeaway I read here was that they realised that when developers feel responsible for deployment they also would take responsibility for application performance, uptime and other goals.
我在这里读到一个有趣的收获是，他们意识到当开发人员对部署感到负责时，他们也会对应用程序性能、正常运行时间和其他目标承担责任。

A learning culture is a key part of DevOps. Even failure can be a success if lessons are learned. (not sure where this quote came from but it kind of makes sense!)
学习文化是 DevOps 的关键部分。如果能吸取教训，即使失败也能成为成功。（不确定这个引言来自哪里，但它确实有道理！）

I have added some other stories where DevOps has changed the game within some of these massively successful companies.
我还添加了一些其他故事，讲述了 DevOps 如何在这些非常成功的公司中改变了局面。

### Recap of our first few days looking at DevOps

- DevOps is a combination of Development and Operations that allows a single team to manage the whole application development lifecycle which consists of **Development**, **Testing**, **Deployment**, **Operations**.
- DevOps 是开发（Development）和运维（Operations）的结合，它允许单个团队管理整个应用程序开发生命周期，该生命周期由**开发**、**测试**、**部署**和**运维**组成。

- The main focus and aim of DevOps are to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes and functionality frequently in close alignment with business objectives.
- DevOps 的主要关注点和目标是缩短开发周期，同时频繁地交付功能、修复和特性，并与业务目标紧密结合。

- DevOps is a software development approach through which software can be delivered and developed reliably and quickly. You may also see this referenced as **Continuous Development, Testing, Deployment, Monitoring**
- DevOps 是一种软件开发方法，通过它可以可靠且快速地交付和开发软件。您可能还会看到它被称为**持续开发、测试、部署、监控**。

If you made it this far then you will know if this is where you want to be or not. See you on [Day 7](day07.md).
如果您坚持读到这里，那么您就会知道这是否是您想要的方向。我们第 7 天见（[Day 7](day07.md)）。

Day 7 will be us diving into a programming language. I am not aiming to be a developer but I want to be able to understand what the developers are doing.
第 7 天我们将深入研究一门编程语言。我的目标不是成为一名开发人员，但我希望能够理解开发人员正在做的事情。

Can we achieve that in a week? Probably not but if we spend 7 days or 7 hours learning something we are going to know more than when we started.
我们能在一周内实现这一目标吗？可能不能，但如果我们花费 7 天或 7 小时学习一些东西，我们都会比刚开始时了解得更多。
